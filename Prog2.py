##Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations addition and division.
# Addition
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number for addition: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number for addition: "))
sum_result = num1 + num2
print(f"sum: {num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}")

##Enter the first number for addition: 9
#Enter the second number for addition: 3
#sum: 9.0 + 3.0 = 12.0
